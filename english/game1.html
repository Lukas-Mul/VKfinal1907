          Women fought for their political and civil rights since the second half of the 19th century.
Among those who strongly advocated for the right to vote were, for example, Alice Masaryková and Františka Plamínková.
In 1873, the right to vote was granted to some women. However, it was very specific: the women had to own a large estate, and the election itself took place through a representative. Therefore, in reality, there weren’t many women who could change anything.

          Karel Kramář was a Czech politician, Russophile and a member of the Young Czech party, which he joined in 1890 together with Tomáš G. Masaryk and Josef Kaizl.
He advocated for a realistic, moderate direction of the party, and supported active parliamentary politics. In 1897 he was elected its chairman.
He lobbied for a reform and pursued the introduction of equal and universal suffrage. After it was approved, he oversaw a rapid transformation of the party and its smooth operation in order to succeed in the next elections.

          <p>84% of voters took part in the elections in the Czech lands. However, the combination of a majority system and the unequal distribution of constituencies distorted <br>the election results. The Social Democratic Party won 37.4% of the vote, but only 22.3% of the seats. The Agrarians, on the other hand, got 24.3% of the vote but won 22.5% of seats. </p> 
          <br>
          <p>The Agrarians won the largest representation in the Vienna Parliament with 28 seats, Young Czechs gained 26 seats, Social Democrats 24 seats, the clerical parties 17 seats, and the Constitutionalist Bloc 9 seats. The progressive and independent candidates had a worse position with only four seats.    </p>
          <br>
          <p>T. G. Masaryk also succeeded as a mostly independent candidate, but he didn’t have any allies among the parties in the Parliament. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The conservative and reformist parties successfully tried to isolate the real winner <br>of the elections, the Social Democrats. The influence of the representatives <br>of the nation at the time, Young Czechs and Old Czechs, was ending. New topics started to appear in politics; the social ones were the most important among them.<br>The proponents of radical left-wing politics were trying to find their way <br>to the spotlight, and the right-wing Agrarians were also growing.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>The elections couldn’t prevent the collapse of the Austrian parliamentarism.  </p>
